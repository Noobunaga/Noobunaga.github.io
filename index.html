		About Me:<br />
		<div class="grid between">
			<ul>
				<li>I started fixing Toyotas after I graduated from UTI at the Chicago Campus and moved back to Minnesota. One of things I loved about working at Toyota I was sent back to class to keep up to date on the new technologies that came out with new vehicles.</li>
        <li>I had a chance to switch automotive companies to Mini Cooper when an old coworker provided an opportunity to work with him again. Along with the switch I was sent to Mini Cooper classes to learn their technologies and vehicles. Learning something brand new in a field I was in for 7 years was a breath of fresh air.</li>
        <li>A little over 5 years at Mini and the global pandemic hit causing the automotive industry to slow. With more people working from home their vehicles see less use which meant less problems that can occur. This is when I started debating whether or not I wanted to stay in the automotive field when the workflow can be inconsistent at times even on a normal year.</li>
        <li>I had talked to a friend of mine who was in the software development field and he had informed me of Prime Digital Academy. He had a great experience with the program and highly recommended it if I was looking for a great field that was only growing due to the pandemic. With that advice and something new to learn I signed up for Prime and got on my new path to software development.</li>
